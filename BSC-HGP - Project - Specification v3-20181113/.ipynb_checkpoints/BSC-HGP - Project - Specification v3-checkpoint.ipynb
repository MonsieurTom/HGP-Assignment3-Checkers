    "- Choose a common development environment, I suggest PyCharm\n",
    "- If you can use a source code manager to develop and share code please do. I would recommend using *git* if you can (particularly if you have access to a *git* server somewhere where all changes can be uploaded).\n",
    "- Decide on a development strategy. Try to work on independent parts if you can. Working in parallel will cut the time in half.\n",
    "- “Weeks of programming can save you hours of planning” a quote from Scott Meyers. Basically it means design the project first before implementing it. This means deciding on your data structures, UI design, view design etc. before you start. Pay particular attention to your data structure for the game board and how you implement the rules. \n",

    "Partner 1 \n",
    "1. Prepare the folder structure in consultation with partner 2\n",

    "3. Examine it\n",
    "4. If satisfied upload the original zip file. If not satisfied restart the process. DO NOT REZIP THE FILE. N.B. If you rezip the file or make any alterations to the file which was given to you by partner 1 then it will not match when i do an sha1/md5 hash comparison. \n",
    "5. Upload it to moodle\n",

    "## 3.2 Penalties\n",
    "- **Code that does no run - 30%** - it can be very time consuming to fix errors which prevent the code from running \n",
    "- **Use of non standard libraries - 20%** - creating new virtual environments is very time consuming\n",
    "- **Bugs - 1 to 15%** - if there there are too many bugs in your code, you could get 0% \n",
    "- **Late submission** - standard late penalties apply\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.3 Tasks \n",
    "Tasks are listed below are intended to be completed in order. Skipping a task may result in lower marks being achieved in later sections as your work cannot be properly tested. You should be capable of producing strong and generally robust software. \n",
    "\n",
    "N.B. High marks will be awarded for better UIs which embody the principles from the lectures. \n",
